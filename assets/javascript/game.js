//first photo connects to javascript

$(document).ready(function() {
    $("#cactus1").on("click", function() {
        console.log("working")
    })
})


//random number is assigned to the random number box

//crystal is clicked

    //$("#cactus1).click(function) {
        //concole.log("working")
        //}

//random number is assigned to crystal---i probably should limit the numbers that can be chosen ( a certain height)

//random number assigned to crystal is shown in box???

//each time a crystal is clicked, its random number adds to the total score

//if the total score reaches the same exact number as the random number chosen, a win happens

//if the total score reaches a higher number than the random number, a loss happens.

//when game restarts, the number of games played goes up by one.



//make sure all photos work together to add numbers??
