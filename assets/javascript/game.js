//first photo

//random number is assigned to the random number box

//crystal is clicked

//random number is assigned to crystal---i probably should limit the numbers that can be chosen ( a certain height)

//random number assigned to crystal is shown in box???

//each time a crystal is clicked, its random number adds to the total score

//if the total score reaches the same exact number as the random number chosen, a win happens

//if the total score reaches a higher number than the random number, a loss happens.



//make sure all photos work together to add numbers??
