  <!--HTML-->





  <!--CSS!-->

* HOW DO I GET THE BACKGROUND IMAGE TO BE MORE OPAQUE WITHOUT MAKING THE ENTIRE DIV BE OPAQUE???
* HOW DO I GET THE BACKGOUND TO COMPLY WITH BOOTSTRAP STUFF? WHY ISNT THE SCREEN RESZING HOW IT SHOULD?
* HOW DO I GET THE TEXT IN THE BOXES TO CENTER UP AND DOWN? WHY WHEN I CHANGE THE PADDING DOES EVERYTHING GET SO MESSED UP??






<!--JAVASCRIPT-->

*WTF IS WRONG WITH LINE 46!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!? WHY IS IT NOT WORKING?!?!!?!?!?!

LINES18-21  *HOW DO I GENERATE A RANDOM NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 200 AND GET IT TO SHOW UP?
LINES66-73 * WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE CODE HERE? IT COUNTS MY CLICKS, BUT IT DOES NOT GENERATE A RANDOM NUMBER, AND NOTHING SHOWS UP ANYWHERE OTHER THAN THE CONSOLE LOG?
LINES84-88 *IS THIS CORRECT? DO I NEED TO CREATE A VAR FOR THESE? IT SEEMS LIKE MY LOGIC IS CORRECT HERE?
            *HOW DO I FLIP THE BACKGRUND IMAGE SO IT LOOKS LIKE ITS RAINING??
            *HOW DO I MAKE IT ANY KEY/CLICK TO RESTART THE GAME AND PUT A NUMBER IN? IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOUDLD BE A GOOD IDEA TO MAKE A SUPER LONG IF/THEN STATEMENT TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN

I WANT TO MAKE CACTI 1 ONLY GENERATE RANDOM NUMBERS MULTIPLES OF 2
    CACTI 2 = MULTIPLES OF 5
    CACTI 3 = MULTIPLES OF 10
    CACTI 4 = MULTIPLES OF 20




HOW DO I MAKE IT SO THAT THE NUMBERS SHOW UP NEXT TO WINS AND LOSSES? WHEN IT RESTARTS? UGH!


ok, so if i make 4 vars called 
    cacti1number
    cacti2number
    cacti3number
    cacti4number
        and then create a var called cactipoints (LINE80) and add them together, will that work to make sure that the cacti points add when the cacti are clicked?
